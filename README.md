# 3D_visualization_in_python
A presentation of some functionnalities of two VTK-based python libraries : PyVista and Vedo

To execute the notebooks you will need :
- python
- jupyter-notebook and ipywidgets : pip install ipywidgets
- vedo : pip install vedo
- pyvista : pip install 'pyvista[all,trame]' (don't forget the quotes !) <- trame is needed to display pyvista window into jupyter notebooks

To begin, have a look at slides/ecosystem.png and then explore the notebooks !
